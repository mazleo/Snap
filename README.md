# Snap

Snap is an image search android application. Upon typing in a search query, the application displays a grid of images to the user. The full image can then be selected and viewed in another screen.

### To Run

There are two ways to install and run Snap. They are:

- Use android studio and run in either an emulator or physical device
    - To do this, clone the project, open it in android studio and wait for the application to build. Then click run (Run > Run 'app'). 
- Download the app-release.apk file from the release folder in the project directory and run it to install, either in an emulator or physical device
    - The device settings might need to be configured to be able to install third-party apps. Enable this to install the app.
